		<p>Student research position in soft condensed materials for JMU’s Physics Department under Dr. Klebert Feitosa where the 	rheology of foam under oscillatory compression was studied.  
		Assembled observable mono and poly dispersed bubble rafts in a controlled tank.
		Obtained raw data by making soap solutions, positioned compressed air needles, maintained observation tanks, managed lightbox and camera operations, and programmed motor for oscillating machinery.
		Created high resolution image video of the fluidization of two dimensional foam for analytic and research purposes.
		Wrote imaging and analysis code in IDL to extract relevant data from videos.  Identified objects and assigned numerical values to track position, velocity and neighboring objects for each frame.  Identified the locations of neighbors switching or T1 Events which was theorized to be and exhibition of the liquid behavior of the system. 
		Prepared written reports summarizing data analysis and conclusions.
		Wrote abstracts and proposals.</p>
